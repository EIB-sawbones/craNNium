craNNium is a convolutional neural network that identifies patients with mild-to-severe dementia.

## Background
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the primary tools used by physicians to identify dementia. Patients with most types of dementia (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration) exhibit structural atrophy in certain regions of the brain. However, identifying the subtle differences in brain structure can be a time-consuming process.

Deep learning methods offer an appealing way to identify dementia patients as a first-pass, but in order to be helpful in a clinical setting, these methods must have high recall and short run-time<sup>[1]</sup>.

In this project, we train a convolutional neural network on T1w MRI data of 200 patients from the OASIS-3 project. OASIS-3 is a compilation of data obtained through the 30-year WUSTL Knight ADRC program of both cognitively normal adults and adults at various stages of cognitive decline<sup>[2]</sup>. OASIS-3 provides a rich and balanced dataset that is ideal for deep learning methods.
